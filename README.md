## Instructions

* Decompress file sdrkef.zip
* Run function setpaths.m to add subfolders to your search path
* Run example microbiome_L6.m


## Dependencies
Some of the functions included in this package rely on procedures previously published in 

Cook, R. D., Forzani, L. M., & Tomassi, D. R. (2011). LDR: A Package for Likelihood-Based Sufficient Dimension Reduction. Journal of Statistical Software, 39(3), 1–20. https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v039.i03
